# Age of Vectron

[![Build Status][travis-status]][travis-build]

These are latex materials for an RPG titled "Age of Vectron" derived from the work of LawfulNice's "Dungeons: The Dragoning 40k 7.6th edition", and the "For a Few Subtitles More" and "Book of Fluff" expansions, followed by the tireless work of the [community][zetaboards] attempting to overhaul some of the mechanics in the "DUNGEONS THE DRAGONING: AGE OF VECTRON" [google document][aov-gdoc].

## Usage

Run `build.bat` or `build.sh` depending on environment to kick-off pdflatex with the options needed to take the folder structure of this project into account.

## License

I claim nothing, but credit for any value I've actually contributed is always welcome.

## Acknowledgements

The styling used is a modified version of [Evan Bergeron's wonderful Dnd 5e template][latex-template]. <!-- TODO: Add the rest. -->
